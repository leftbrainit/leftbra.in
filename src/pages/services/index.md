Technology that's too complicated, poorly chosen or just plain broken, kills productivity and makes people sad. Our Strategists partner with our clients to create **beautifully simple** workplace technology experiences for their teams, so they always have the right set of tools, ready to get to work whenever (and wherever) they are.
