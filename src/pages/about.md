LeftBrain was founded 2009, to help creative people do more with technology. We set out to build a tech company centred around the needs of people (our customers, our team and our partners).

More than 12 years on, while we’ve evolved from a scrappy startup to a mature business, we remain true to that initial vision and maintain that startup mentality in everything we do.

We’re not finished evolving: in fact we’re only just getting started!
