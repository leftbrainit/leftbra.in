LeftBrain provides ambitious teams with workplace technology: keeping systems, devices and the people who use them, happy, high performing and secure. 

Founded in 2009, we have designed, delivered and maintained digital workspaces for hundreds of organisations, enabling many of them to grow (as we have) from ambitious startups to established enterprises. We put together a tailored tech roadmap for each of our clients, taking time to get to know their team, understand their ways of working, then recommending the best tools to get the job done. 

Our team is agile, qualified, and fun to work with, with competencies in [strategy](/services#strategy), [information security](/services#security), [human support](/services#support), and [infrastructure](/services#infrastructure). We offer a range of ongoing services and one-off projects, which can be mixed and matched to achieve your individual business goals.
