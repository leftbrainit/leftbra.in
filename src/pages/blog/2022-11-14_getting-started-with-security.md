### Certifications

Cyber Essentials and ISO27001 are the leading industry standards for security but which certification is best for your business? 

C﻿yber Essentials is a UK Government program that covers an entry level of IT security and reduces the risk of most cyber attacks by roughly 80%. Not bad, right? Your company is required to have Cyber Essentials if you are working with government, handling personal data, or providing technical services. More and more of our customers are striving towards getting their Basic and Plus certifications in landing deals with other supply chains and organisations who only engage with compliant companies.

I﻿SO27001 is an international set of standards for handling IT security which is more comprehensive, covering additional areas of business which can leave you more vulnerable. It includes all information security and accessibility such as Human Resources and Legal Compliance, instead of just having an IT focus.  In turn, it takes much more time to build towards than Cyber Essentials.  We can help you get certified by ensuring that at least the minimum amount of documents laying out the appropriate policies, records, and procedures are in place for audit before taking a course and passing the exam. 

In short, Cyber Essentials covers the basics to create a solid foundation of cyber security practices in the UK. If you’re dealing with mostly international clients, or you're a bigger business that wants to dive deeper into security requirements, then ISO 27001 is generally a good choice. Can you have both? Of course! We see Cyber Essentials as a stepping stone to ISO27001 and encourage all our customers to invest in both of these badges.

### D﻿evice protection through MDM

R﻿ecent improvements in MDM (Mobile Device Management) software has created a blueprint for success when it comes to managing and protecting our customer's devices. By automating repetitive management tasks, an MDM boosts security by eliminating human error when provisioning machines for first time use and governs what employees can and can't do with their workstations from the get go. Now, which MDM should you use at work?

Well, Mosyle is great for Apple environments and with the growing number of threats specifically designed to infect Macs, their integrated security tools allow automated compliance, prevention and remediation, without impacting performance and usability, which is a big win for our customers. 

J﻿amF is also Apple friendly and their Endpoint protection minimises risk from common threats like malware and potentially unwanted apps without [threat prevention and remediation](https://www.jamf.com/solutions/threat-prevention-remediation/)compromising security, privacy or performance as well. The remote wipe feature comes in hand if a device is lost or stolen should shift hit the fan.

InTune is cool too and our Windows users love it - and what's not to love considering there are far more infections targeting Windows so there is real value knowing that you're safe and can get on w﻿ith doing the great work that you do. The cloud console is easy to configure and provides you with protection across your favourite Microsoft services like 365 and even Xbox too.
