We asked the team to shed some light into their remote setups and work stations, and how they've gotten on during this new approach to working. It's amazing to see some of the tech in use that makes remote working so seamless. Let's look at some of the most mesmerising kits.

A﻿ll the way from Johannesburg, South Africa, Lewis Karume helps our customers with all their tech support issues so they can get on with the great work that they do. How you may ask? Let's find out.

Q﻿. Tell me Lewis, what enables you to do such a great job for LeftBrain from the other side of the globe in SA?

A﻿. I have my MacBook Air M1 to thank. This is the fastest Mac I've ever had and makes helping our customers even more of a pleasure. Being remote has lead me to run multiple apps at the same time, so I picked up a Samsung 32" Monitor to extend my screen and free up my real estate. I also have a mini DC ups to power my wifi router and fibre box for about 8 hours straight which is essential with the recent power outages we've unfortunately been experiencing. 

Q﻿. And is there any tech you have in mind to take your setup to the next level?

A﻿. I have my eye on the Anker 563 10-in-1 USB C dock which allows me to connect a 2nd external display to my M1 Mac so I can spread out my workflows even further. 

Q﻿. Lastly, what has been your favourite and least favourite thing about remote working?

A﻿. My favourite has to be is not being stuck in traffic everyday and least favourite is not being able to connect with people face-to-face. I really miss seeing the smiles I put on their faces.

Going remote has allowed Ben Carrick to make the move from cold London to an island called Lošinj in Croatia and has been thriving in his new, relaxing surroundings. No wonder he has done such great work for our Client Advocates team. 

Q﻿. So Ben, what have you put together in your new workstation in Croatia?

A﻿. I'm working off a MacBook Air M1 connected to a 4K LG Monitor to house the million tabs I tend to switch between. The 16GB of RAM helps a lot with my workload and with most of my work in the cloud, I could get away with the base 256GB hard drive. 

Q﻿. What else can we add to the mix here?

A﻿. Definitely a standing desk, I've gotta look after my health and have spent too long slouched over a laptop!

Q﻿. I'll be sure to put in a good word with HR! And what has been your favourite and least favourite thing about remote working? 

A﻿. My favourite is definitely jumping in the Adriatic Sea on my lunch breaks. It's such a treat! Least favourite would probably be missing out on all the spontaneous chats over cups of tea with the team.

B﻿ased in London, Dustin Rhodes heads up our New Business and Projects team from the comfort of his home.  This power hungry user needs a well-equipped setup. Let's dive in.

Q﻿. Dustin, I am totally blown away by this setup. Please walk me through it.

A﻿. Breakdown:

* Hydraulic standing desk with an ergonomic chair for obvious health benefits.
* Sonos speaker for podcasts and Spotify to break the silence.
* For work, Apple MacBook Pro 14" with an external 4K monitor on the right to ensure enough space for all my windows.
* iPad Pro with Apple Pencil for note taking and diagram drawing.
* AirPod Pro’s for calls and meetings.
* Underneath the desk I have a test Synology DS1618+ for replicating issues on clients setups without having to fiddle on a live system, along with new feature testing.
* My gaming PC for personal use.
* Connecting it all together is a Unfi Dream Machine Router with a 4G modem as a failover to ensure 100% uptime.

Q﻿. I feel silly asking but is there anything else you're looking at investing in?

A﻿. At the moment, nothing springs to mind.

Q﻿. And what has been your favourite and least favourite thing about remote working? 

A﻿. My favourite thing is being able to spend my breaks with Ethan, our new born.

Least favourite thing is trying to find the off button as the space is associated with work and home.
