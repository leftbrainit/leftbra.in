We asked the team to shed some light into their remote setups and work stations, and how they've gotten on during this new approach to working. It's amazing to see some of the tech in use that makes remote working so seamless. Let's look at some of the most mesmerising kits.

A﻿ll the way from Johannesburg, South Africa, Lewis Karume helps our customers with all their tech support issues so they can get on with the great work that they do. How you may ask? Let's find out.

Q﻿. Tell me Lewis, what enables you to do such a great job for LeftBrain from the other side of the globe in SA?

A﻿. I have my MacBook Air M1 to thank. This is the fastest Mac I've ever had and makes helping our customers even more of a pleasure. Being remote has lead me to run multiple apps at the same time, so I picked up a Samsung 32" Monitor to extend my screen and free up my real estate. I also have a mini DC ups to power my wifi router and fibre box for about 8 hours straight which is essential with the recent power outages we've unfortunately been experiencing. 

Q﻿. And is there any tech you have in mind to take your setup to the next level?

A﻿. I have my eye on the Anker 563 10-in-1 USB C dock which allows me to connect a 2nd external display to my M1 Mac so I can spread out my workflows even further. 

Q﻿. Lastly, what has been your favourite and least favourite thing about remote working?

A﻿. My favourite has to be is not being stuck in traffic everyday and least favourite is not being able to connect with people face-to-face. I really miss seeing the smiles I put on their faces.

Going remote has allowed Ben Carrick to make the move from cold London to an island called Lošinj in Croatia and has been thriving in his new, relaxing surroundings. No wonder he has done such great work for our Client Advocates team. 

Q﻿. So Ben, what have you put together in your new workstation in Crotia?

A﻿. I'm working off a MacBook Air M1 connected to a 4K LG Monitor to house the million tabs I tend to switch between. The 16GB of RAM helps a lot with my workload and with most of my work in the cloud, I could get away with the base 256GB hard drive. 

Q﻿. What else can we add to the mix here?

A﻿. Definitely a standing desk, I've gotta look after my health and have spent too long slouched over a laptop!

Q﻿. I'll be sure to put in a good word with HR! And what has been your favourite and least favourite thing about remote working? 

A﻿. My favourite is definitely jumping in the Adriatic Sea on my lunch breaks. It's such a treat! Least favourite would probably be missing out on all the spontaneous chats over cups of tea with the team.

B﻿ased in London, Dustin Rhodes heads up our New Business and Projects team from the comfort of his home.  This power hungry user needs a well-equipped setup. Let's dive in.

Q﻿. Dustin, I am totally blown away by this setup. Please walk me through it.

A﻿. Under the desk is a custom built PC with a Synology DS1618+ used for LeftBrain testing. Up top is a 14" MacBook Pro M1 Pro chip that works great with my iPad Pro to extend my screen using Sidecar. The Dell 55hz 2K gaming monitor goes hand in hand with my PC used for private use, mostly gaming. I love my Philips Hue that controls all lighting in the house using Siri, and the Unifi Dream machine router with 4G failover makes sure i'm always online for when my team or customers need me. I also use Apple Airpods Pro’s for work, they great for when commuting on the tube with noise cancelling. The hydraulic standing desk that houses it all was built by me. 

Q﻿. I feel silly asking but is there anything else you're looking at investing in?

A﻿. With the newest member of the Rhodes family being born recently, a baby monitor would be great to keep an eye on him in between meetings. The Cubo Ai Plus Smart Baby Monitor looks like a winner

Q﻿. And what has been your favourite and least favourite thing about remote working? 

A﻿. My favourite is less commuting and being able to be with baby Ethan. Least favourite is working and living from the same place. I find it hard hard to switch off.
