Today’s fast-pace digital world has made it almost impossible to remember and track things. Thankfully we are spoilt for choice when it comes to storing, sharing and collaborating with our data. The challenge now comes from deciding which solution to go with so let me help you decide on the best data practices for your business.

### Where to store

We've put a lot of thought around some of the ways our customers are storing their data and with the recent cloud evolution, we've mulled over whether cloud or on-premise servers are a better fit for you.

Particularly in remote working environments, cloud solutions like Google Drive and Dropbox take preference because of the seemless ways to access data on the go and at a relatively low cost compared to the up keeping of an on-premise server. And while physical office servers such as a Synology file server can still be accessed remotely using VPN solutions, if there is a break in connection, someone will need to return to office to resolve - or you can just call one of our on-site engineers to come out and save the day :)

However, if you are easing back into or are fully in office, and deal with large files such as renders or raw images, it can be beneficial to work off a shared file server that's quicker to access compared to working from a cloud folder which varies dependent on your internet speed.

### W﻿hat about backups?

I﻿m glad you asked! It's calming to see all the changes and improvements made to both cloud and physical backup technology, and how the two can actually work together in safe-keeping your precious data. I'm particularly impressed with the new Google Drive desktop app's backup feature that replicates selected files on your computer to your cloud storage with a click of the button. Dropbox and Onedrive include this feature too and while Dropbox seem to have this waxed, I find Onedrive can be picky over which files can or can't be backed up - good luck if you're a PST file, and please make sure there are no unwarranted spaces after file or folder names as you will receive red alert, sync errors for days. What's really neat is how your Synology file server can work hand in hand with your cloud service of choice in backing up current or archive data, giving you an additional layer of fall back should disaster strike.

### S﻿haring

Sharing is caring, but only if done correctly. So which service should you use to share company data? Let's weight up the pro's on con's of some popular tools. 



**Dropbox**

Pro's - W﻿orks well Office files such as Word docs and Excel sheets - and even allows for editing online within Dropbox.

C﻿on's - No dedicated email solution compared to the likes of Google with Workspace and Microsoft for 365.



**G﻿oogle Drive**

Pro's - The shared drive feature allows you to make a range of team or department specific files that can be easily shared within our organisation. 

C﻿on's - Can create multiple versions of the same file when working with large files.



**OneDrive and Sharepoint**

Pro's - Great bang for your buck for the amount of storage you get as part of the 365 suite.

C﻿on's - Requires extra steps when sharing with external non Microsoft account users. But don't worry, we can help  configure this for you, so your customer can still access the great work that you do.



**S﻿ynology file server**

Pro's - fast and effective for large files that are being collaborated on. Creators really benefit from this.

C﻿on's - hardware heavy which requires an investment in infrastructure.

### Collaborating page

T﻿hese days, most attacks are targeted at your email, app and other account services, away from your device itself, leaving you increasingly susceptible. Have no fear though as MFA (Multi-factor Authentication) provides an additional layer of verification by means of a text or sign in prompt to confirm it is in fact you trying to sign in, should your account find its way in the wrong hands. You know when you enter your Apple ID into a new device, and all your Apple gadgets start singing and dancing with an approval code? That is MFA for you. 

T﻿ake it one step further and there is SSO (Single Sign On) which allows you to use on account, like your Gmail, to then sign into other services such as Slack or Notion, without having to create a new account for that service - nor remember additional passwords. Victory! Not quite, as this can create backdoors if the main account you are using to authorise additional signs is breached, which is why we use something called Okta which adds even more authentication and authorisation services for your top apps.

### C﻿losing remarks

W﻿e are nothing without our data.
