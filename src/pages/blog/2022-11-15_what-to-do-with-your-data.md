Today’s fast-pace digital world has made it almost impossible to remember and track things. Thankfully we are spoilt for choice when it comes to storing, sharing and collaborating with our data. The challenge now comes from deciding which solution to go with so let me help you decide on some of the best data practices for your business.

### Where to store

We've put a lot of thought around some of the ways our customers are storing their data and with the recent cloud evolution, we've mulled over whether cloud or on-premise servers are a better fit for you.

Particularly in remote working environments, cloud solutions like Google Drive and Dropbox take preference because of the seemless ways to access data on the go and at a relatively low cost compared to the up keeping of an on-premise server. And while physical office servers such as a Synology file server can still be accessed remotely using VPN solutions, if there is a break in connection, someone will need to return to office to resolve - or you can just call one of our on-site engineers to come out and save the day :)

However, if you are easing back into or are fully in office, and deal with large files such as renders or raw images, it can be beneficial to work off a shared file server that's quicker to access compared to working from an online cloud folder which varies dependent on your internet speed.

### W﻿hat about backups?

I﻿'m glad you asked! It's calming to see all the changes and improvements made to both cloud and physical backup technology, and how well the two can actually work together in safe-keeping your precious data. I'm particularly impressed with the new Google Drive desktop app's backup feature that replicates selected files on your computer to your cloud storage, with a click of the button. Dropbox and Onedrive include this feature too and while Dropbox seem to have this waxed, I find Onedrive can be picky over which files can or can't be backed up - good luck if you're a PST file, and please make sure there are no unwarranted spaces after file or folder names as you will receive red alert, sync errors for days. What's really neat is how Synology file servers can work hand in hand with your cloud service of choice in backing up current or archive data, giving you an additional layer of fall back should disaster strike.

### How to share

Sharing is caring, but only if done correctly. So which service should you use to share company data? Let's weight up the pro's on con's of some popular tools. 

**Dropbox**

Pros - W﻿orks well with Office files such as Word docs and Excel sheets, and even allows for editing online within Dropbox without the Microsoft Suite installed.

C﻿ons - There is still no dedicated email solution compared to the likes of Google with Workspace and Microsoft for 365.

**G﻿oogle Drive**

Pros - The shared drive feature allows you to make a range of team or department specific files that can be easily shared within our organisation. 

C﻿ons - You can create multiple versions of the same file when working with large files.

**OneDrive and Sharepoint**

Pros - Is great bang for your buck for the amount of storage you get as part of the 365 suite.

C﻿ons - Can require extra steps when sharing with external non Microsoft account users. But don't worry, we can help configure this for you, so your customer can still access the great work that you do.

**S﻿ynology file server**

Pros - Is fast and efficient for large files that are being collaborated on. Creators really benefit from this.

C﻿ons - Can be hardware heavy which requires an investment in infrastructure. Our Infrastructure team has your back though in making the right move.

### Ways to collaborate

Now that we know how to store and share our files, the next step is deciding how best we can work together with our data. Using the cloud solution of your choice, it's easy to track changes made by teammates, and if someone makes a mistake, it's possible to restore back to previous versions of the file you're working on. I find Apple's iWork suite really impressive when it comes to rolling back changes in a Time Machine inspired way within Pages, Keynote or Numbers. The 365 suite also works well when it comes to undoing changes within Excel, Word or Powerpoint by seeing who did what and when. My colleagues and I tend to work tirelessly within Google Sheets and Docs and the comments feature makes it easy to share insight into what we are trying to achieve in certain sections, should it be unclear. And when crunching numbers on Sheets from our respective desks, being able to trace Dependents and Precedents saves time when trying to work out where totals were tallied from. What also works well for us is dropping our Drive files into a Slack channel to then discuss and work together in getting the job done. If MS Teams tickles your fancy, then being able to access Onedrive and Sharepoint files within a chat Window can save time looking up your work, with the option to jump on a quick call to discuss your doings in more detail, is really helpful as well.

### C﻿losing remarks

Data is core to what we do across all industries and I hope you have a better sense of some of the ways in which choosing the correct solution can benefit your business. At the rate at which tech companies are growing, it's likely here will be a new unicorn data handling business launching tomorrow, so keep an eye out for our newsletter to see how this disrupter can take your team to the next level.
