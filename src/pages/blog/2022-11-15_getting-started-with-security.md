D﻿ata breaches and cyber attacks cause sleepless nights for anyone running a business or IT department. So we've put together a new SecOps (Security Operations) Team to protect and ensure peace of mind when it comes to our customer's device and account security. If you have any doubts over the state of your security, use this hero's checklist to help keep the bad guys out.

### Certifications

Cyber Essentials and ISO27001 are the leading industry standards for security but which certification is right for your business? 

C﻿yber Essentials is a UK Government program that covers an entry level of IT security and reduces the risk of most cyber attacks by roughly 80%. Not bad, right? It's required if you are working with government, handling personal data, or providing technical services. More and more of our customers are striving towards getting their Basic and Plus certifications, to strike deals with other supply chains and organisations who only engage with compliant companies.

I﻿SO27001 is an international set of standards for handling IT security which is more in depth, covering additional areas of business which can leave you at risk. It includes all information security and accessibility such as Human Resources and Legal Compliance, compared to just having a general IT focus.  So it takes more time to build towards. And we can help you get certified by ensuring that the required documents laying out appropriate policies, records, and procedures are in place for audit, before taking a course and passing the exam

In short, Cyber Essentials covers the basics to create a solid foundation of cyber security practices in the UK. If you’re dealing with mostly international clients, or you're a bigger business that wants to dive deeper into security requirements, then ISO 27001 is generally a good choice. Can you have both? Of course! We see Cyber Essentials as a stepping stone to ISO27001 and encourage all our customers to invest in both of these badges.

### D﻿evice protection through MDM

R﻿ecent breakthroughs in MDM (Mobile Device Management) software has created a manual for success when it comes to managing and protecting customer's devices. By automating repetitive management tasks, an MDM boosts security by eliminating human error when provisioning machines for first time use and governs what employees can and can't do with their workstations from the get go. Now, which MDM should you use at your work or school?

Well, Mosyle is great for Apple environments and with the growing number of threats targeting your Mac, these integrated security tools allow automated compliance (great for Cyber Essentials btw), prevention and remediation, without impacting performance and usability, which is a big win for our customers.

J﻿amF is also MacOS friendly and their Endpoint protection minimises risk from common threats like malware and potentially unwanted apps through threat prevention and remediation as well. It's time to nip Mackeeper in the bud! The remote wipe feature comes in hand if a device is lost or stolen. 

T﻿here is also Duo which is a dream when it comes to guarding company devices as it easily ensures all staff are running the latest Operating System - to the point where apps stop working if not up to date, and gives an overview of each security process running such as FireVault hard drive encryption and Firewall network barriers.

InTune is cool too and our Windows users love it - and what's not to love considering there are far more infections hitting Windows PCs so there is real value knowing that you're safe by integrating with mobile threat defence services like Microsoft Defender for desktop protection. The cloud console is easy to configure and provides you with a shield across your favourite Microsoft services like 365 and Teams.

### A﻿ccount security through MFA and SSO

T﻿hese days, most attacks are targeted at your email, app and other account services, away from your device itself, leaving you increasingly susceptible. Have no fear though as MFA (Multi-factor Authentication) provides an additional layer of verification by means of a text or sign in prompt to confirm it is in fact you trying to sign in, should your account find its way in the wrong hands. You know when you enter your Apple ID into a new device, and all your Apple gadgets start singing and dancing with an approval code? That is MFA for you. 

T﻿ake it one step further and there is SSO (Single Sign On) which allows you to use on account, like your Gmail, to then sign into other services such as Slack or Notion, without having to create a new account for that service - nor remember additional passwords. Victory! Not quite, as this can create backdoors if the main account you are using to authorise additional signs is breached, which is why we use something called Okta which adds even more authentication and authorisation services for your top apps.

### C﻿losing remarks

Despite what's been discussed today, there is always more to learn and implement when it comes to protecting your tech with new threats nesting every day, so stay tuned to see what else can be done to enhance your security in time.
