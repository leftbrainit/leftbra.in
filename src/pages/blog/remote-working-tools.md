Hello world! Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Adam, an Apple nerd, engineer, entrepreneur and now, I'm proud to say, an inaugural member of the Communications team here at LeftBrain!

Running my own business in my home town of Cape Town, SA, I've had my eyes on LeftBrain for a while, as friends and former colleagues joined up, and evangelised about their unique culture, progressive approach to technology. The kind of place where entrepreneurial people like myself thrive.

I discovered the wonders of LeftBrain through friends, but looking from the outside in, you'd never know. With almost all new business coming through referrals, they're (as they freely admit) terrible at Marketing! Or rather, they just don't do it.

So my pitch to them was simple. Bring me on board, and let me shout your name from the rooftops. Let me tell the world about all the weird and wonderful things you do.

Obviously they said yes üôÇ

In 3 weeks here, the first thing that struck me, and what I'll cover today, is how easy it's been integrating with the team, as a remote employee. In fact, I'm told that, even before remote work became a necessity, they were already operating this way.

So as a first post, I wanted to highlight a couple of the great tools we're using, so that others might benefit.

*Notion*

If you haven't already, it‚Äôs time to put your faith in Notion.

This project management gem is the best thing since the internet itself and helps the team coordinate, collaborate and conquer their goals. Check out this demo of their Project Tracker which they easily built themselves to oversee their projects from start to finish. My favourite part about Notion is that it requires no coding or database background and can be configured to your business‚Äôs best practices. Not to mention can be easily shared with your customers.

There are other tools out there like Airtable, Trello and Monday.com but these are less customisable and user friendly compared to Notion IMO.

Try it out and if you need help maximising this tool, mail me: [adam@leftbrain.it](mailto:adam@leftbrain.it).

*Google Workspace*

I know what you‚Äôre thinking, why Google Workspace over something like Microsoft 365?

There is a strong case for both solutions but going Google made more sense when LeftBrain transitioned to a cloud based email solution because of the benefits with collaboration at the time (through live editing on shared files) which Microsoft only recently mastered, and a more user friendly experience. The Workspace suite is packed with hidden gems such as Meet With which allows you to see your colleagues schedule in Google Calendar before jumping on a quick Meet or Talk, or email automation when it comes to client follow ups or predictive text. I find setting up Groups really handy and cost effective when it comes to sharing an email account such as hello@yourorganisation.com with respective team members without having to incur extra license costs. How cool is that?

Let me know some of your favourite Workspace features, or try sway me to the dark side with some 365 tricks.

*Calendly*

‚ÄúLet me check my diary and get back to you‚Äù

How many times have you said that to a customer?

With Calendly, you can save time with your scheduling and in turn free up slots in your calendar to be even more available to your network. This tool plugs in your iCal, Google Calendar and 365 Calendar so your attendees can book a meeting slot that matches your current availabilities. You can setup automations that asks invitee‚Äôs questions to find the best service for their needs, and can even add locations from in person to a video conferencing solution that suits your style. I find the pre-meeting email reminders really helpful when working at 1000 miles per hour, and the post-meeting follow up forms a great way to get feedback on your services.

Ive used Timely in the past but struggled to tailor it to my needs and ended up being more cost effective as I needed to pay for each event type where Calendly only charges per user license.

*Slack*

Still using jurassic email? Move to Slack for a modern take on inter-team and external communication.

Don‚Äôt get me a wrong, there are still some dealings that need to be done on email when it comes customer proposals, legal stuff etc but just about everything else can and should be channeled through Slack. You can setup different channels where team members can discuss projects, day to day work requirements and more. It‚Äôs one of the reasons I fitted straight into LeftBrain. From day one I was welcomed with open arms into our canteen style channel and was greeted by my new teammates with warm wishes, banter, gifs, emojis, you name it.

If chat isn‚Äôt doing the trick, you can get on a quick huddle and dial in to discuss over voice or video whatever it is that you need from your team.

It is also a great way to engage with customers by inviting them to a shared channel to ensure synergy between your respective organisations.

Google Workspace and Microsoft Teams are slowly catching up when it comes to chat but I still feel Slack is winning the race.

*1Password*

How many times has a colleague asked you what is their password for just about every app under the sun? With 1Password, you can securely share team account passwords and save time trying to crack the Davinci Passcode on your own. You can autofill passwords saved in your vault across browsers, apps and devices. It really is password paradise.

As 1Password Partners, you can save on your subscription by signing up through LeftBrain.
