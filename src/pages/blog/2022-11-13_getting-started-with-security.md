D﻿ata breaches and cyber attacks cause sleepless nights for anyone running a business or IT department. So we've put together a new SecOps (Security Operations) Team to protect and ensure peace of mind when it comes to our customer's devices, infrastructure and account security. If you have any doubts over the state of your security then abide by this hero's checklist to help keep the bad guys out.

### Certifications

Cyber Essentials and ISO27001 are the leading industry standards for security but which certification should you consider for your business? 

C﻿yber Essentials is a UK Government program that covers an entry level of IT security and reduces the risk of most cyber attacks by roughly 80%. Your company is required to have Cyber Essentials if it’s working with the government, handling personal data, or providing certain technical services. More and more of our customers are working towards getting their Basic and Plus certifications in securing business with other supply chains and organisations who only engage with compliant companies.

I﻿SO27001 is an international set of standards for handling IT security which is more comprehensive, covering additional areas of business which may leave companies more vulnerable. It includes all information security and accessibility such as Human Resources and Legal Compliance, instead of specifically having an IT focus.  This means it takes significantly more time to build towards than Cyber Essentials.  We can help you get certified by ensuring that at least the minimum amount of documents laying out the appropriate policies, records, and procedures are in place for audit before taking a course and passing the exam. 

In short, Cyber Essentials covers what you need to create a solid foundation of cyber security practices in the UK. If you’re dealing with mostly international clients, or if you are a bigger business that wants to dive deeper into security concerns, then ISO 27001 is generally a good choice. Can you have both? Of course! We see Cyber Essentials as a stepping stone to ISO27001 and encourage all our customers to invest in both of these badges.
