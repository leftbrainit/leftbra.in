We are delighted to have Troy on board. Meet the man behind the Memoji and discover what he gets up to during and after his Tech Support All Rounder Duties.

Q﻿. Hey Troy! When you aren't visiting clients, where do you help them from?

A﻿. Im currently based and working from Brixton, South London.

Q﻿. And what exactly do you do at LeftBrain?

A﻿. I'm part of the Tech Support All Rounder Team, or how we like to call ourselves, "ET2". Our role is spread out and we help across other teams which means I'm always learning new tricks.

Q﻿. Awesome! Are you working on anything particular right now?

A﻿. We've been doing loads of Mosyle roll outs, an MDM (Mobile Device Manager) which helps us manage our customers' devices remotely. I've also been helping Dayne and his team on the support side, and Dustin's team with projects.

Q. Busy guy! And when you're not putting smiles on customers' faces, what do you enjoy doing in your downtime?

A﻿. I love to paint and coach football. Having weekends off helps maximise my spare time.

Q﻿. So tell me, what has been the best part about working here?

A﻿. Being mostly a Mac environment has been awesome! I come from a Windows background and have found Mac so much easier to support. I've also really enjoyed being exposed to security solutions and hope to spread my wings there soon.

Q﻿. And is there anything else you can tell me about you that makes you stand out here?

A﻿. Well my family is originally from Ghana, not sure if the rest of the team even knows that! You should really try visit some time. You'll get the best Jollof of your life there!

Q. That's so cool! What else can you tell me about Ghana?

A﻿. Well, the capital Accra is now the second most expensive city in Africa. And we're finally back in the FIFA World Cup this year so you can cheer us on as we represent Africa, where you're also from.

T﻿hat's all from Troy today. We'll be meeting other members of our family in future posts so stick around.
