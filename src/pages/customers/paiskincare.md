Pai puts sensitive skin at the heart of everything they do. They formulate, manufacture and ship their certified organic products from their London HQ, but wanted LeftBrain to ensure their workplace technology was secure when accessed from any location.

“The vast majority of our workplace technology works seamlessly,” says Ed Saper, Co-Founder of Pai Skincare. “In previous companies I’ve worked in, the IT department is constantly harassed and everything seems to be very technical and complicated. Working with LeftBrain is a completely different experience. There’s no doubt that their solutions are very complicated, but the team does a brilliant job of making everything seem very simple. Often they just get on with fixing issues without us even noticing, which keeps things running seamlessly.”

## Cloud-hosted workstation accessible on any device

Most of Pai’s product development takes place on Mac devices, but some of their departments rely heavily on a Windows based database software to keep track of their ingredients, product formulations and confidential business records. Pai approached LeftBrain in 2019, wanting to securely migrate as many services to the cloud as possible, whilst enabling both Mac and Windows devices to access their database and collaborate securely from any location. 

## Building a bespoke AWS infrastructure, secured with Zero Trust

LeftBrain’s information security engineers created a bespoke solution, using an AWS (Amazon Web Services) virtual server infrastructure to enable the team to access the data securely, through the use of a Zero Trust Network and DLP (data loss prevention) mechanisms. We also moved their Identity and Access Management to a cloud based system, so they could use one secure set of credentials across all their environments – from their wifi network to Active Directory and SaaS services.

Pai has an incredibly capable back-end infrastructure, which LeftBrain has built. I’d be surprised to find another company of our size that has a fraction of the capabilities that we do. Working with LeftBrain has enabled us to punch above our weight.

Going forward, LeftBrain continues to maintain Pai’s systems and monitor their cyber security whilst being on hand to support the team with day-to-day queries via the help desk.
