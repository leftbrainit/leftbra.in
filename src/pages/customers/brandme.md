LeftBrain has been working with BrandMe for over ten years. During the pandemic, our teams worked together to transition their traditional office workspace in Covent Garden to a more flexible, cloud-based environment so staff could work from home.

“I’m really proud of the work we do,” explains Celine Smith, Managing Director of BrandMe. “We created the original Taste the Difference brand for Sainsbury's in 1999, and have been brand guardians ever since, seeing its value grow to one billion pounds. More recently, we relaunched the nakd raw fruit & nut bar and have been doing lots of work for them." 

LeftBrain have been looking after BrandMe’s workplace technology for almost ten years, designing and building their infrastructure, visiting their offices twice a week, and ensuring all their employees receive excellent support through our help desk. “We fell in love with LeftBrain from the beginning,” Celine says. “They were recommended to us by our Finance Consultant, and we found that they matched the collaborative way we worked: it felt like their engineers were part of the team.”

During the pandemic BrandMe needed to transition from being a traditional workplace set up to having a flexible, hybrid working policy whilst keeping their data protected and their systems secure.

## Flexible and secure cloud-based technology

LeftBrain’s team of information security engineers managed a complete overhaul of BrandMe’s tech, migrating their onsite server to Google Drive and ensuring their systems were Cyber Essentials certified. They also had a custom built, on-premise Windows database application, which we migrated to an AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud infrastructure so it could be securely accessed from any location whilst maintaining the same performance.

“The project went really well,” Celine says. “It was seamless, we never had any loss of efficiency. LeftBrain were super quick to respond to all the challenges, and were in constant contact with us finding ways to improve things.”
