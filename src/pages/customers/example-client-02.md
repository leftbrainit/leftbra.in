excerpt: Content Caching (built into macOS High Sierra) is an oft ignored
  feature that can speed up delivery of Apple software updates, iOS apps, well
  as personal iCloud data for homes, businesses, and institutions by delivering
  content from local computer storage over the LAN, rather than going out to the
  Internet each and every time.

[Forpeople](https://forpeople.com/) is a creative studio, based in London and Amsterdam. They use creativity to make visionary ideas real and are the kind of people we love to work with! Previously they had their own internal workplace tech team, but found when they had a turnover of staff or people were on holiday it caused disruption to their systems. They also had an increasing number of clients requiring them to be Cyber Essentials Plus certified, so we came on board as an outsourced member of their team, to provide security guidance and seamless tech support.

## Cyber security and outsourced tech support

Working hand in hand with our LeftBrain security experts, Forpeople reduced their internal tech department down to one person who remained on site as our main point of contact. We then took over the delivery of all their tech needs, from building an workplace infrastructure fit for the purpose of passing Cyber Essentials Plus through to user support, ongoing maintenance and continuing security governance.

With their Cyber Essentials Plus certification now in place, we continue to support the team in London and Amsterdam to keep them in line with the latest cyber requirements. This requires us to always be ahead of the game, looking out for the latest security threats specific to their business. We also provide ongoing support for their cloud based infrastructure at a high level, so that their in-house tech person can focus on the on site support and their creative team can focus on coming up with the visionary ideas they are here to make real!
