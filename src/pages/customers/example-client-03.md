excerpt: Content Caching (built into macOS High Sierra) is an oft ignored
  feature that can speed up delivery of Apple software updates, iOS apps, well
  as personal iCloud data for homes, businesses, and institutions by delivering
  content from local computer storage over the LAN, rather than going out to the
  Internet each and every time.
